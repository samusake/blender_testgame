================

A small test of the Blender Game Engine, whith Drag and Drop, fancy normal maps, dynamic lightning and some riddles

:D
To Test this program you only need Blender (www.blender.org)

I’m happy about every review and anybody, who use the program and makes it better.


To do list:
1.Textures not in the .blend file
2.level 2 not completed
3.quest in room 2, the key shouldn’t go down, after you put him inside the keyhole
4.quest in room 2 is too hard
(you have to take the key, who is over the lamp and put him inside the keyhole (which is at the right of the door), than you have to throw grenades with G against the cupboard)




controls:
wsad: move
left click: action
space: jump
g: grenades
f: flashlight
